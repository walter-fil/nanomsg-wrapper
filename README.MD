d-nanomsg
=========
* D language bindings for the [nanomsg library](http://nanomsg.org/documentation.html) and idiomatic D wrapper API
* See [dlang.org](https://dlang.org) for more about the D Programming Language
* Ported to Dlang (2014,2015,2016) by Laeeth Isharc.  Caveat emptor.
* Examples are from [dysinger](https://github.com/dysinger/nanomsg-examples/blob/master/README.org)
    - I have added one more example: filesend.d that demonstrates sending a text file
